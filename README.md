## User Guide
Calculator can only do math operation with single digit values. Therefore, enter a single digit number then an operator and another single digit value. To get the result, press the equals button to get the value. A/C is fully functional so it can reset the values and can do another math operation. The "+/-" button and "%" has no functionality yet.

(I was not feeling the best last night. Chest felt tight due to lingering effects of covid-19 that's why calculator has little functionality).
